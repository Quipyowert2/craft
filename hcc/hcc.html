<H1>HCC A Refinement Precompiler for C++</H1><P>
<HR>

Nearly all modern programming languages
provide methods for programming at the module level. This
includes mechanisms for defining procedures and functions, as well as
packets or classes.  However in general there are no features that
support programming within procedure bodies.  Within a procedure
body itself there are no further powerful statements enabling an
aesthetically pleasing top-down development of the code.  This gives rise
to one of two undesired effects:
<UL>
<LI> Either there are ugly mountains of nested brackets representing the
     nested blocks,
<LI> there are only small procedures with ridiculously large parameter lists,
     because everything must be a parameter.
</UL>
Refinements allow further structuring inside a procedure, to prevent these
effects.
