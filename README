Source Code of CRAFT
====================

How to compile ?

You need the following things to compile craft :


- The file craftcc.tar.Z 
  (from ftp://borneo.gmd.de/pub/as/janus/craft/craftcc.tar.Z")

- The gnu g++, gcc command

- A shell-script interpreter

- The tar, compress command 

- and Xlib
 
Now you can start to do the following things.

- place craftcc.tar.Zin a new directory (e.g. craft) and "untar" it.

- edit "install" and change paths for libs and call of gnu stuff
  (only a few lines)

- execute install

If everything is proper it will take a bit to compile craft. If this
process is finished, you will have an executable craft in the
directory afterwards. Now you can call it.

Crafts needs a proper directory-structure which contains the various resource
files used by craft. Its structure looks like :

  craft         "the executable"
  .windefaults  "sugar for the window system"
  \buttons      "contains the button icons"
  \hcraft       "contains pictures of units and menus"

This structure is automatically produced during the unpacking of the source
code files. You should compile in the top directory of the above
directory tree.

Why no Makefile ?

I hate makefiles !!! This dammed stuff is always a good source for many
obsolete bugs. Therefore we don't use make for our projects, but
if you like to have a makefile, it should be easy to convert install.

Finally

This source code is free, everybody may do everything with it, if it is not
used commercially. I guarantee absolutely nothing, everything is at your
own risk and I explicitly warn you not to compile or play the game :-).

By the way if there are a few guys who are interested in further development
of the game, mail me. I would be interested to hear your ideas and tips.
