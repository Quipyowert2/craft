<H2>How to compile ?</H2>

You need the following things to compile craft :

<UL>

  <LI>The file
      <A HREF="ftp://borneo.gmd.de/pub/as/janus/craft/craftcc.tar.Z">craftcc.tar.Z</A>

  <LI>The gnu <B>g++</B> and <B>gcc</B> command

  <LI>A shell-script interpreter

  <LI>The <B>tar</B> command 

  <LI>And <B>Xlib</B>
 
</UL>

Now you can start to do the following things.
<UL>

<LI>place <A HREF="ftp://borneo.gmd.de/pub/as/janus/craft/craftcc.tar.Z">craftcc.tar.Z</A> in a new directory (e.g. <I>craft</I>) and "untar" it.

<LI>edit <I>install</I> and change paths for libs and call of gnu stuff
    (only a few lines)

<LI>execute <I>install</I>

</UL>

If everything is proper it will take a bit to compile craft. If this
process is finished, you will have an executable <I>craft</I> in the
directory afterwards. Now you can call it.


Crafts needs a proper directory-structure which contains the various resource
files used by craft. Its structure looks like :

<TABLE>
<TR><Td> craft         <Td> "the executable"
<TR><Td> .windefaults  <Td> "sugar for the window system"
<TR><Td> \buttons      <Td> "contains the button icons"
<TR><Td> \hcraft       <Td> "contains pictures of units and menus"
</TABLE>

This structure is automatically produced during the unpacking of the source
code files. You should compile in the top directory of the above
directory tree.

<H2>Why no Makefile ?</H2>

I hate makefiles !!! This dammed stuff is always a good source for many
obsolete bugs. Therefore we don't use <I>make</I> for our projects, but
if you like to have a makefile, it should be easy to convert <I>install</I>.

<H2>Finally</H2>

This source code is free, everybody may do everything with it, if it is not
used commercially. I guarantee absolutely nothing, <B>everything is at your
own risk and I explicitly warn you not to compile or play the game :-)</B>.

By the way if there are a few guys who are interested in further development
of the game, mail me. I would be interested to hear your ideas and tips.
