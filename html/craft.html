You are a Viking, and, one fine day, after drinking a bit to much
beer, you fall out with the leader of your settlement. After several
unpleasantries, the upshot of it all is that you and two of your
equally drunken companions have to make a break for it!.  An historic
moment, because you three guys establish a new nation. Since you are
obviously even too lazy to work, your companions vote you to be
King. So let's have a look and see whether you have what it takes to
build up a new and powerful kingdom, or whether you are just another
one of life's losers. To make things a wee bit tricky there just
happens to be a few more of your sort, trying to establish their own
kingdoms; so a few problems along the way are certainly
foreseeable. Your main task is to command your own citizens.

Ships are essential if the landscape consists of islands. Without
ships it would be impossible to leave your home island to conquer
other islands.  Sooner or later the resources of your initial island
will be exhausted, so the ability to leave this island is crucial for
survival. Ships are built in <A HREF="#docks">docks</A>. A ship can
carry upto 12 men.  In order to row a ship anywhere at least one man
must be on board. As for any other unit, the ship has a measure of
health. This represents the current damage status of the ship. If the
health is zero the ship is completely damaged and it will sink. In
this situation all the men on the ship will be forced to swim for
their lives. Unfortunatly you forgot to teach your men how to swim
:-).  On clicking on a ship a <A HREF="#ship control panel">ship control

<IMG ALIGN = LEFT SRC="pic/shcopa.gif"><P>
<UL>
  <LI> The <I>sail</I> order causes the ship to sail towards the specified
       point.
  <LI> The <I>concentrate</I> order causes the selected members of the crew
       to walk to the specified point. This point may be some point on land,
       if the ship is at the coast, or it may be a point on another ship
       if it is alongside. A ship can only be
       entered if it is empty, or if there are already some of your men
       on the ship.
  <LI> The <I>attack</I> order causes your ship to move into
       <A HREF="#long range">long range fight distance</A> to the specified
       goal. Once this distance is reached the ship tries to remain within
       this distance, even if the goal is moving.
       This order can be used to enable the <A HREF="#archer">archers</A>
       and <A HREF="#catapult">catapults</A> on your ship to attack an enemy.
  <LI> The <I>enter</I> order is used to bring your ship alongside another
       ship. After docking beside the goal ship a heavy fight between your crew 
       and the others will ensue. Once both ships are locked to
       one other there is no escape until the fight is decided.
       After killing all crew members in the other ship one of your men will
       enter the other ship.
</UL>
As mentioned above empty ships can be entered by anybody. This can be used to
steal a ship if there is nobody looking after it.

To give orders to the crew members, they must be marked in the
ship control panel. This can either be done using the mouse
(left = mark, middle = toggle), or it can be done
by the to <I>crew select buttons</I> at the buttom of the control panel.<P>

<IMG SRC="pic/markcap.gif">
   This button toggles marking the captain of your ship (the first man on ship).<BR>
<IMG SRC="pic/markall.gif">
   This one will toggle marking the whole crew, but the captain's marking will be untouched.<P>

If more than one ship is marked by <A HREF="#select">multiple selection</A> it
becomes impossible to give orders to individual crew members. Therefore the
<I>ship control panel</I> disappears in this case.

If a ship is hit by any weapon of an opponent, the hit either causes damage to
the ship itself or to the ship's crew. The crew members can be
healed by <A HREF="#scientist">scientists</A> on the ship. If the
ship is damaged there is no way of repairing it. This means ships can never be
repaired, therefore you should always have at least one site with
 <A HREF="#docks">docks</A> to build new ships if the existing are becoming
too greatly damaged.

Your <A HREF="#worker">workers</A> can <A HREF="#construct orders">construct</A>

repaired under the guidance of one of your scientists. Normally a building 
supports only a limited number of citizens of a special kind. The 
construction of buildings will consume gold and wood. The amount of material 
required is shown in the <A HREF="#order panel">order panel</A>. The
gold-colored numbers denote the <A HREF#gold# required, and the green numbers

A town hall is essential for your nation. Without a town hall you can't 
construct other buildings. Additionally town halls are the central trading 
places for your nation. The gold and wood harvested by your workers is stored 
in your town halls. Town halls can recruit <A HREF = "#worker">workers</A> 
and <A HREF="#pawn">pawns</A>. The number of existing town halls per
nation is limited to two for scenarios on land and it is limited to four for
those with oceans. Of course town halls can be reconstructed if they have

arbitrary numbers.

Docks are used to build ships. Each dock can build as many ships as you wish.
But a ship itself is not armed. Therefore it makes no sense to build a lot
of ships if you do not have enough men to form the crews. To build
a dock you need 3x3 squares at height 1 adjacent to the water. Normally 
buildings are not that resistant to attacks because they can
be protected by walls. But docks cannot be surrounded by walls, therefore
docks are built much more robustly to protect them against attacks from sea.

<A NAME = "h orders">
<A NAME = "orders">
<H1>Orders</H1>

There are various classes of orders which can be given to the different 
<A HREF="#citizen">citizens</A> and the administration of 
<A HREF="#building">buildings</A>. Each profession or building supports
different mixtures of orders. When a citizen receives a new order he forgets
his current order and starts obeying the new one.
In case of the <I>IDLE</I> order this means an immediate stop.

<A NAME ="move orders">
<A NAME = "h move orders">
<H2>Move Orders</H2>

There are two kinds of move orders. The difference lies in their behavior if a 
<A HREF="#select">multiple selection</A> is active. In case of a
<A HREF = "#select">single selection</A> there is no difference between 
these two orders.<P>

Ordering <I>move</I> will preserve the actual formation of the selected 
citizens. During their march, the formation may temporarily be interrupted, 
but at the final position the initial formation will be restored. The 
<I>move</I> order is only accepted if all members of the 
<A HREF="#select">multiple select</A> can reach their 
<A HREF="#destination">destination point</A>. The citizen selected first
will be moved exactly to the <A HREF="#destination">destination point</A>.<P>

After ordering <I>concentrate</I>, all selected citizens will try to reach the
<A HREF="#destination">destination point</A> as near as possible. 
This means formations are lost and not all citizens exactly reach the
destination point, but in principle the destination point must be reachable 
by each of them, otherwise the order is not accepted.<P>

While carrying out a move operation the route may be blocked by 
obstacles such as a walls, buildings, etc. Additionally each individual has
its own idea of a nice route. Therefore it may happen that the 
<A HREF="#citizen">citizens</A> work along unexpected routes. E.g. they may 
decide to leave a fortification, even if you prefer a way somewhere behind 
your walls. In this case you have to provide subgoals to force your men to use 
the routes you'd like to see them taking.<P>

Many orders like <A HREF="#harvest order">harvest</A> or
<A HREF="#fight orders">fight</A> may produce movements implicitly
if this is required to come closer to an important point (e.g. to hit an 
opponent).

<A NAME = "guard order">
<A NAME = "h guard order">
<H2>Guard Order</H2>

All your fighting citizens obey the <I>guard</i> order. The man looks out for 
enemies and if any goal is seen within a range of 6 fields, then it is 
attacked automatically.

<A NAME = "fight orders">
<A NAME = "h fight orders">
<H2>Fight Orders</H2>

There a 4 different ways of starting a <A HREF="#fight">fight</A>.
The explicit <I>attack</I> order is used to force the 
<A HREF="#select">selected</A> troops to attack the <A HREF="#citizen">
citizen</A> or <A HREF="#building">buildings</A> at the 
<A HREF="#destination">destination point</A>, if there are any. In the case of 
<A HREF="#catapult">catapults</A> it is also possible to order an attack to 
destroy a wall.<P>

The order <I>search and destroy</I> causes the 
<A HREF="#select">selected troops</A> to attack any foreign 
<A HREF="#citizen">citizen</A> or <A HREF="#building">building</A> near the 
<A HREF="#destination">destination point</A>. If an enemy leaves the 
<A HREF="#destination">destination area</A> it will not be followed by 
your troops. <I>Search and destroy</I> can be used to clear a 
selected area of enemies without causing a redistribution of your troop 
concentrations.<P>

The order <I>follow and destroy</I> works like <I>search and destroy</I>, 
but the enemy is followed by your troops. This may result in a radical 
redistribution of the troops, but it is quite useful for eliminating scattered
enemies that have no chance of receiving reinforcement.<P>

And finally each of your armed men performs self-defence if it is approached 
by an enemy in range of his own weapon. But the men don't walk, 
they don't even run away. Thus a <A HREF="#scientist">Scientist</A> will 
<A HREF="#cast orders">cast</A> all his own <A HREF="#citizen">citizens</A> and 
<A HREF="#building">buildings</A> which are close to him if their
<A HREF="#health">health</A> is below maximum.<P>

Finally it should be mentioned that it is impossible to attack your own 
<A HREF="#citizen">citizens</A>, but you may attack your own 
<A HREF="#building">buildings</A>. E.g. if mines have been exhausted,
it is quite useful to destroy 
your own <A HREF="#town hall">town halls</A> and to rebuild them near a fresh 
mine somewhere else.

<A NAME = "recruit orders">
<A NAME = "h recruit orders">
<H2>Recruit Orders</H2>

All buildings except a <A HREF="#town hall">town hall</A> and a 
<A HREF="#farm">farm</A> have the ability to perform recruit 
automatically, if the current resources are above a specifiable level.
There are two dials in the <A HREF="#order panel">order panel</A>

A <A HREF="#worker">worker</A> can perform two kinds of excavation

the height of the <A HREF="#landscape">landscape</A> by one step, and
<I>heaping</I> increases the height. Depending on the heights of the

See the description of the <A HREF="#landscape">landscape</A> to
understand the consequence of these orders.<P>

If an <I>heap</I> or <I>dig</I> order is to be performed on a square
this can be ordered by <I>heap to</I> and <I>dig to</I>. E.g. if these
operations are applied along a column or line of width one, it can
easily be used to build walls or moats. Heaping and digging requires
small amounts of <A HREF="#gold">gold</A> and <A HREF="#wood">wood</A>

<A HREF="#excavation order">dig</A> too deep, then you will hit the
water table  and flood the hole and all neighboring fields that are
below sea level. If any land reaches a height above sea level,
then it 
will automatically turn to dry <A HREF="#mud">mud</A> land. This enables 
<A HREF="#worker">worker</A>s to cross rivers by applying the

<H2>Landscape in a bit more detail</H2>

In fact the story of the different land heights is a bit complicated.
Each square of land has four neighbors, each of which 
may have a height differing from that of the middle
square. The difference may be any values from -3 to +3. Depending on this
difference, the corresponding edge of the actual square will be anything 
from a normal peace of land to a fortification. See in the table below
for details.<P>

As you can see, only positive differences are taken into account, the
negative ones are not needed because the neighboring fields are changed
accordingly in the case of a hole.

Any difference larger than 3 is not valid, (some damned programmer
disabled that :-), therefore it may happen that an <A
HREF="#excavation order">excavation order</A> is simply not executed.
Anyway you should try a bit to understand what's going on, and the
meaning behind the different landscape layouts.  A final hint:
normally units can move to any of the 8 neighboring fields, including
diagonal moves. When there is a height difference between two fields,
diagonal moves are not possible. This is because your <A
HREF="#citizen">citizens</A> are always a bit drunk and they will fall
if they have to ascend or descend on a slope. The valid orders also
depend on the land type as described below.<P> Normally a worker can
<A HREF="#excavation order">heap</A> or <A HREF="#excavation
order">dig</A> to/from any neighbouring square or on the square it is
standing on.  The only execption is that it is not allowed to heap at
a square which is two or more units below the current square the
worker is standing on. This means <A
HREF="#fortification">fortifications</A> cannot be enlarged from the
inner side, you have to leave your secure walls to do this!<P>

<H2>Long Range Fights</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="pic/lrf.gif" HEIGTH=40 WIDTH=167>

Stones and Arrows can be used to attack an enemy over a long
distance. The range of a stone is one field larger than the range of
an arrow. Arrows are dangerous, but stones take the biscuit. Long
range fights are only allowed if the landscape properties allow
them. Trees and bushes are no barrier. Any field which is more than two
units higher the the field of the shooter cannot be passed by the
line of fire. E.g. a <A HREF="#fortification">fortification</A> can
not be passed by a shot from a shooter, at the bottom of the walls. In
case of an arrow, the unit on top of the fortification is not hit and
an arrow can't damage any wall. In the case of a stone, the unit on
top is also not hit but the wall is damaged with a likelihood of
0.3. Damage means the height of the wall is decreased by one.

<H2>Short Range Fights</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="pic/srf.gif" HEIGTH=64 WIDTH=94>
      
All weapons (except stones) can also be used for man-to-man fights. In 
this case both enemies must be located on neighboring fields. In the case of 
arrows, the <A HREF="#fortification">fortifications</A> have the same effect
as in long range fights. Any other weapon can only by applied if the height 
difference between the two opponents is less than two. If a hitting unit
is lower than the attacked unit, the power of the hit is only 20% of the
strength it would have if both stand at the same level (as mentioned above
this is not valid for arrows).
This means building <A HREF="#wall">walls</A> and <A HREF="#fortification">fortifications</A>
improves defensive power significantly. Walls prevent 
invasion and short range fights, while fortifications prevent
attacks with long range weapons.

<H2>System Requirements</H2>

There are precompiled versions for LINUX and SUNOS 4.1.3. The SUNOS version also runs under
SOLARIS normally.

<UL>
  <LI> The SUN should be an IPX or better.
  <LI> The game is further optimized to be playable on LINUX PC's with 486/100 or better.
         The main problem is that the game requires a relatively high
amount of RAM, therefore the PC should have >= 16Mb RAM.

<H1>How to call the game?</H1>

To call the game, you must always be in the directory where the executable
"craft" is located. This is needed since the game has no proper installation
and therefore only relative paths are used to locate all data files needed.<P>
The game can be called as "craft". Now the <I>option panel</I> is displayed. It is used to 
setup the general game parameters and the type and number of players and their properties.

     The human may either have a king or not.
     If there is a king, the player loses if the king is killed.

     The scope of the player may be limited to a local sight around the

     There are either 2 or 3 human players or one human and one robot player. 

<LI> <B>with isalnds</B><BR>
     The game may play "on land" or the landscape may consist of an ocean
     with various islands.  

<LI> <B>seed</B><BR>
     The landscape is generated by random. If a seed is entered (any sring
     of letters), it is used as start value for the random. Therefore
     a seed can be used to reproduce the same landscapes by using the
     same seeds.

</UL>
<P>

Anyway you should make sure that the <I>xhost</I> permissions are properly
set, since this game is not a client-server game. The calling task always
wants to open windows on the other players' hosts.

<H1>The robots</H1>

I spent a lot of time improving robots from version 2.x to version
3.x.  In version 2 it was quite simple to kill the robot if it was
forced to attack a fortification. In the current version, the robot
knows a bit more about "how to attack fortifications". It is not
perfect, but I hope it plays much better. In a conflict with ships, a
single wrong decision can be fatal (e.g. losing a ship with many
expansive catapults on it). Therefore the robot does not play that
well in worlds with islands, I am still working on it, but it may
need much more time. I have tried many other games like C&C, Z or
Warcraft and I am proud to say that I think my robots are
"quite intelligent" (even if they are still unbelievably stupid) !!!

<IMG ALIGN = LEFT SRC="pic/hua.gif" HEIGTH=70 WIDTH=92 >

This game is a more or less serious offspring of our work on adaptive
agent systems. The final intention of this game is its use as an
experimental environment for different automatic adaptive players.
The whole thing should finally run in a client server version, which
enables the participants of the game to act in real time concurrently.
The quicker one can give orders, the quicker one may do it.
The game should have closed rules (is ok), should be quite complex
(is true for these silly adaptive methods) and should also motivate a
human to play online against these crazy adaptive robots (check it out).<P>
<BR CLEAR = LEFT>

So long, HUA
